Description: Based on external numerous data files where rfPred scores
        are pre-calculated on all genomic positions of the human exome,
        the package gives rfPred scores to missense variants identified
        by the chromosome, the position (hg19 version), the referent
        and alternative nucleotids and the uniprot identifier of the
        protein. Note that for using the package, the user has to be
        connected on the Internet or to download the TabixFile and
        index (approximately 3.3 Go).
